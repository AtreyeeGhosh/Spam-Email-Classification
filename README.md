# Spam-Email-Classification
 This project implements a spam email classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. The model leverages Naive Bayes for classification and Count Vectorizer for feature extraction. A simple, interactive interface built on Streamlit allows users to classify emails as spam or ham in real-time. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and can be easily deployed and integrated into email systems for efficient spam filtering.
