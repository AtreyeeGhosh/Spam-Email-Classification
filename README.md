# Spam-Email-Classification
 This project implements a spam email classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. The model leverages Naive Bayes for classification and Count Vectorizer for feature extraction. A simple, interactive interface built on Streamlit allows users to classify emails as spam or ham in real-time. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and can be easily deployed and integrated into email systems for efficient spam filtering.

<h1> Features <h1>
- **Email Classification**: Enter an email and classify it as either Spam or Not Spam.
- **Model Performance**: View accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report on the dataset.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The result is displayed with a colored background to clearly indicate whether an email is Spam (red) or Not Spam (green).
